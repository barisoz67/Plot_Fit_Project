# Code Explanation

This python code uses the opencv package to produce polynomial fits on a plot shown in a specific image. User defines the path of the image, real coordinates (values shown on the plot axes) of two reference points and degree of the polynomial to be used in the curve fit function. When the code is run, user selects the two reference points on the image and other points to be used for the curve fit. When any key is pressed, the code opens up the second window that shows the original image and the curve fit produced for the specified plot as well as the selected points
